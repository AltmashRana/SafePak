# SafePak
In today's world, people using smartphones have increased rapidly, and hence, a smartphone can be used efficiently for personal security or various other protection purposes. Various heinous incidents that outraged the entire nation have wakened us to go for the safety issues and so a host of new apps have been developed to provide security systems to every individual via their smartphones. Therefore, the aim of this project is to provide a mobile application to ensure the well-being of individuals by calling for help with certain gestures on their mobile phones. The unique feature of this application is that in case of emergency you can not only contact your close friends but also nearby users of the application who are willing to help you. The interesting part will be the automatic camera recording, in which the phone’s camera will turn on by performing a certain gesture and start recording. The recorded video will be saved inside the gallery. Moreover, it will gather useful data i.e. suspects’ faces to inform higher authorities about highly alert areas. On top of that, the application provides its users with a platform where they can also socialize by posting their everyday status and interacting via chat. Also, when it comes to a medical emergency i.e. blood donation, the users can donate as well as receive blood.
